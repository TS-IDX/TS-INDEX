## FTP Server using the Winsock control


</div>

### Description

This is a simple FTP server I developed using the Winsock control. Its got a few bugs in it that need to be solved as well as some missing features. But I think you will find this useful. It is more complete than any other FTP servers posted here. Its got plenty of comments so I hope it is easy to follow.

If you make any additions or improvments please let me know. Would be neet if we could make this sort of a collaborative effort towards a decent FTP server.

Updated: *FIXED sending files to the client. (FINALLY!)
